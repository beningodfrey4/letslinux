# Let's Linux #007: i3 rename instances

https://youtu.be/9ZJLMid348M

In this video i show how to rename the instance of a window by using `xdotool` and some advanced features of my script `i3run`. The program we experiment with is the filemanager `thunar`. 

i3run is a shell script that lets you run, raise or hide a window or command with a single hotkey in i3wm. It is part of the 'i3ass' suite that can be found on github:

I use the program `wmctrl` in this video:

I also use the program `xdotool`:

The documentation for thunars *hidden settings* can be found here:  
https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/hidden-settings

The file where `thunar` store the *hidden settings* is located in:  
`~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/thunar.xml
